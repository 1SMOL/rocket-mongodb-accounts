# Rocket &heartsuit; MongoDB User Authentication

This is a learning project, and half decent starting point for newbies like me that would enjoy a reference on how to implement mongodb into their own projects for user authentication. Another project will focus on storing, sorting, and viewing blog posts from a mongodb database.

## Side notes

I will avoid any form of formatting that-to me-causes the code to be less readable compared to other languages that newbies like me come from.

If you do plan on making anything production ready; you'll obviously want to hash passwords with SHA-256 or other industry standard hashing algorithms for user account safety, you'll also need to do _a lot_ more sanitizing of user inputs, this can be done with JS or through the server itself.
